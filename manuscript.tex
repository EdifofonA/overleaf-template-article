\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This article introduces various wrappers for the Stata \texttt{estout} package \citep{Jann2005,Jann2007} that allows one to generate various summary statistic and regression tables in \LaTeX. Rather than going into the details of the \texttt{estout} package options, which are fairly extensive, the aim of this document is to provide ``templates'' for easy  replication. This is an evolving document so please check regularly for updates. Since \LaTeX requirements change over time, please see the change log for details, or message me to fix errors if they occur. And please feel free to request or suggest other table formats.
